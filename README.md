# PasswordGenerator
***

## Objective
- I Created a web page to generate passwords, using what I've learned this week on JavaScript.  
- Included a *prompts*, *alerts*, and *confirm* so the user can specify the type pf password they need. 
- Used *math.random* in my *for loop* to generate the password characters. 

## Credits
  I would not have been able to make this password generator without the assistance of my tutor Sangeetha. She walked me through the stages of starting my JavaScript file and, helped me better comprehend the required syntax.
